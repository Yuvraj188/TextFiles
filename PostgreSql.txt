Difference bw database schema and tables:
database:A database is a collection of related data organized in a way that allows for easy retrieval, management, and manipulation. It serves as a container for schemas and other objects like tables, indexes, and views.
Example:

Consider a database named company_db. This database might contain information related to employees, departments, and projects.

2. Schema
Definition:

A schema is a namespace within a database that contains database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and functions. Schemas help to organize and group these objects logically within a database. Each database can have multiple schemas, and objects within a schema are referred to by a combination of the schema name and the object name.
Example:

Within the company_db database, you might have a schema named hr that contains tables related to human resources, and another schema named sales for sales-related data.

3. Table
Definition:

A table is a collection of rows and columns used to store data. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field of the record. Tables are the fundamental building blocks where actual data is stored.
Example:

Within the hr schema of the company_db database, you might have a table named employees that stores data about employees.



select datname from pg_database;//to check all the data bases
create database <db_name>;//to create a db 
query executed only when semi colon is executed
\c dbname; to change the database we are using
drop database test;//to delete the db

2) to rename a database 
Ensure no active connections to the database you want to rename.
Connect to a different database (not the one being renamed).
Use the ALTER DATABASE command to rename the database.
ALTER DATABASE test_db RENAME TO new_test_db;

3) create a table 
create table person(id int,name varchar(100),city varchar(50));

\d person;  //to describe the table person

4)insert data 
 insert into person values(1,'uv','jaipur');
5)modify 
update person set city='london' where id=4;
6)delete data
delete from person where id=4;
