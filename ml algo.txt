1)
supervised ml
independent feature-many(input)
dependent feature-one(which is to be predicted)
2)in regression problem output will be a continuous variable
-Continuous variables can take any value within a range and can be infinitely subdivided.
-Discontinuous (categorical) variables consist of distinct categories with clear separations, and observations fall into one specific category.(ex gender(either male or female))
3)classification problem=> when there are fixed no. of output then classification ex pass or fail. if 2 output then binary classification otherwise multiclass classification


4) unsupervised machine learning(no dependent variable )
two main problems 1) clustering -> find similar groups not have outputs like supervised ex-customer segmentation
                  2)dimensionality reduction ->reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving as much relevant information as possible.
